## 💫 About Me:

I’m a dedicated and detail-oriented **Computer Science graduate from GCU Lahore** with a strong foundation in programming and database systems.  
Proficient in **C++**, **Java**, and **Dart**, with hands-on experience in both web and mobile development.  
Skilled in **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**, **Agile methodology**, and the **Scrum framework**.  
Passionate about building accessible, impactful tech solutions that solve real-world problems.

During my internship at **Shaukat Khanum Hospital**, I completed frontend development tasks and internal system simulations under IT supervision, gaining exposure to professional workflows.  
I’ve also led media and publicity efforts at the **GCU ACM Student Chapter**, reflecting both technical and leadership growth.

I enjoy clean UI, logical architecture, and projects that blend empathy with technology.  
Always open to collaboration and learning — let's connect and create meaningful software!
