## 💫 About Me:

I’m a dedicated and detail-oriented **Computer Science graduate from GCU Lahore** with a strong foundation in programming, UI design, and interactive application development. I specialize in **React**, **Flutter**, **Java**, and **C++**, with hands-on experience in real-world projects such as sign language interpretation, quizzes, and sorting visualizations.

During my internship at **Shaukat Khanum Hospital**, I contributed to web development projects and gained experience working with professional teams. I’ve also led media and publicity efforts at the **GCU-ACM Student Chapter**, showcasing both my technical and leadership skills.

I'm passionate about clean UI, logical systems, and combining emotional intelligence with software. I'm actively seeking opportunities to collaborate, grow, and innovate. Let’s connect and build something meaningful!
